### Libraries used

You can install everything from requirements.txt, otherwise install packages as you go through the notebook. All required packages are listed in the notebook as well.

### Loading Datasets

The dataset is not available in our zip due to storage constraints. Ensure you provide the train\_ and test_data.csv files, and place them into the correct (./cda-lab-1-credit-card-fraud/) directory

### Main Notebooks

- Lab 1: [Lab1](Lab1.ipynb)
- SMOTE: [lab1_smote](lab1_smote.ipynb)
- Rank Swapping: [lab1_rank_swapping](lab1_rank_swapping.ipynb)

### VENV

I use python 3.12.3 in a conda environment to run this assignment, I suggest you do too, and install all dependencies easily from [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)
